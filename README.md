# Space Adventure
## Description deliverable
### Elevator Pitch
With so many mind-numbing apps today that only allow you to meet one boring objective, it's important to keep your mind creatively engaged. That's why Space Adventure allows users to explore a virtual world through choosing different paths to take. Each decision leads to another, and when your path reaches an ending you are rewarded with an acheivement which you can share with friends. Then, you can begin again and choose a different course, gaining a new achievement each time you finish a path.
